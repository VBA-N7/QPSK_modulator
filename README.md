# QPSK Modulator
This python script allows you to visualize QPSK modulation on a binary trame. Differents graphs are displayed to understand the process and how it works. 

You can type a custom binary trame or choose to generate a random binary trame with a custom bit lenght *(line 77 to line 79)*

Frequency and baud rate are also customizable. *(line 83 to line 84)*
